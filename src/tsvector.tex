The GIN key is of type \sqlinline{text}.  We can encode them to DocDB
\cppinline{kString}.  For example, \sqlinline{"the"} is encoded to
\cppinline{"Sthe\x00\x00"} for ascending and
\cppinline{"a\x8b\x97\x9a\xff\xff"} for descending.\footnote{see
\cppinline{AppendEncodedStrToKey}}  Since UTF-8 strings are guaranteed to not
have bytes \cppinline{"\x00"}, \cppinline{"\xfe"}, or \cppinline{"\xff"}, it
should be simple to create bounds for prefix search.  In fact, this is already
happening for queries like \sqlinline{col LIKE 'foo\%'}, which turn into a
\cinline{QL_OP_BETWEEN} of \cinline{"foo"} and \cinline{"fop"}.

Range partition is needed for efficient prefix queries.  Otherwise, hash
partition is fine.
