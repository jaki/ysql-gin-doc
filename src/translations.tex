For example, the \sqlinline{=} operator for arrays makes sure that the indexed
array column equals the query array. This can be done by

\begin{nparts}
\item
  For each distinct element $e$ in the query array $A_q$, get a set of tuples
  $T_e$ where the tuple's row's array contains the element $e$:
  \[
    \forall e \in A_q, T_e = \opget_I(f)
  \]
  where
  \[
    f(i) = \parens{i \qeq e}
  \]
\item
  Intersect the tuples $T_e$ to filter out any tuples whose row's array doesn't
  contain \textbf{all} of the query array's elements:
  \[
    T = \opand_{e \in A_q}(T_e)
  \]
\item
  Recheck each row to make sure the \sqlinline{=} operator is satisfied.
\end{nparts}
